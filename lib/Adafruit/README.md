The files here were obtained from:

* https://github.com/darevish/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code/tree/master/Adafruit_L3GD20
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code/tree/master/Adafruit_LSM303
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_BMP

The ones starting with lower-case letters are barely-modified files from the above, but with their filenames changed so I can easily keep track of which part numbers go with which components.

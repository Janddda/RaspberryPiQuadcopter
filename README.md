# Raspberry Pi Quadcopter

In this project, I am building a quadcopter powered by a Raspberry Pi.

The software side of this was started on February 18, 2016.

The quadcopter will consist of:
* 4x brushless motors
* 4x ESCs
* Battery/SBEC/low-voltage alarm
* Raspberry Pi 2
* GPS
* 10-DOF IMU
* Maybe a LIDAR
* Maybe some ultrasonic range sensors
* Pi camera
* Wifi card. It will act as an access point, allowing connection from another device which may be used to control the quadcopter.
* LEDs

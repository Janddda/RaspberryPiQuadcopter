# Raspberry Pi Quadcopter

In this project, I am building a quadcopter powered by a Raspberry Pi.

The hardware side of this project was started on February 1, 2016, and the software side of it was started on February 18.

## Quadcopter Parts List:
* [4x brushless motors and ESCs](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=76073)
* [Battery](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=84097), [SBEC](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=64373), and [low-voltage alarm](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=58506)
* [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)
* [GPS](https://www.adafruit.com/products/746)
* [10-DOF IMU](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1604)
* Maybe a [LIDAR-Lite](http://pulsedlight3d.com/) (link goes to v2 but mine is the now-discontinued v1)
* Maybe some [ultrasonic range sensors](http://www.robotshop.com/en/hc-sr04-ultrasonic-range-finder.html)
* [Pi camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/)
* Wifi USB adapter. It will act as an access point, allowing connection from another device which may be used to control the quadcopter.
* LEDs
* [Frame](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=66323) and [propellers](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=84400)

The motors will be controlled by [Weimin Ouyang's fork](https://github.com/tylerwowen/RPIO) of [Chris Hager's RPIO library](https://github.com/metachris/RPIO)
